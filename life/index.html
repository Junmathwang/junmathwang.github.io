			<p>When I'm not thinking about math, I enjoy watching movies and listening to music. In particular, I love albums of musician Duo, Wei.
				To help you get a taste of his unique but diverse music style, I recommend listening to his album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfzSG5zgsEY&list=PLQVSxpMW_Srh33hjBqjLoiAtteutLJ5-e">天真君公(Tian Zhen Jun Gong)</a> first.
