			<p>When I'm not thinking about math, I enjoy watching movies and listening to music. In particular, I love albums of musician Duo, Wei.
				To help you get a taste of his unique but diverse music style, I recommend listening to his album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoWJhzxD0jI&list=PL9OL8a7fuusPxRME8HPyiMpxVxco0Iw1y&index=2&t=0s">天真君公(Tian Zhen Jun Gong)</a> first.

			<p> His another album I will recommend is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIZqr38iFi4">殃金咒(Yang Jin Mantra)</a>.

			<p>Yang Jin Mantra is a Buddhist mantra being recited when a people die, but her/his soul hasn't been assigned to go the hell or heaven. This album is said to be inspired by the news that thousands of dead pigs floated on the Yangtze River (the longest river in China), which 
				drove Duo, Wei to record this album to wake people's environmentally conscious. Another theme-related album (with his collaborators) that I'll also strongly recommend is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4483Hk9yzo">潸何吊(Shan He Diao)</a>.
