			<p>When I'm not thinking about math, I enjoy watching movies and listening to music. In particular, I love albums of musician Duo, Wei.
				To help you get a taste of his unique but diverse music style, I recommend listening to his album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoWJhzxD0jI&list=PL9OL8a7fuusPxRME8HPyiMpxVxco0Iw1y&index=2&t=0s">天真君公(Tian Zhen Jun Gong)</a> first.

			<p> His another album I will recommend is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIZqr38iFi4">殃金咒(Yang Jin Mantra)</a> (Be prepared before clicking!).

			<p>Yang Jin Mantra is a Buddhist mantra being recited when a people die, but her/his soul hasn't been assigned to go the hell or heaven. This album is said to be inspired by the news <a href="#interview">[1]</a> that thousands of dead pigs floated on the Yangtze River (the longest river in China), which 
				drove Duo, Wei to record this album to wake people's environmentally conscious. Another theme-related album (with his collaborators) that I'll also strongly recommend is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4483Hk9yzo">潸何吊(Shan He Diao)</a>.
