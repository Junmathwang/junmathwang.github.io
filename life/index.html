			<p>When I'm not thinking about math, I enjoy watching movies and listening to music. In particular, I love albums of musician Duo, Wei.
				To help you get a taste of his unique but diverse music style, I recommend listening to his album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfzSG5zgsEY&list=PLQVSxpMW_Srh33hjBqjLoiAtteutLJ5-e">天真君公(Tian Zhen Jun Gong)</a> first.

			<p> His another ablum I will recommend is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIZqr38iFi4">殃金咒(Yang Jin Mantra)</a>.

			<p>Yang Jin Mantra is a Buddhist mantra, which is recited when a people died but her/his soul hasn't been assigned to go the hell or the heaven. It's said that this ablum was inspired by the news that dead pigs floated on the Yangtze River (the longest river in China), which 
				drived Duo, Wei to record this ablum to wake people's environmentally conscious. Another related ablum that I'll also strongly recommend is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4483Hk9yzo">潸何吊(Shan He Diao)</a>.
